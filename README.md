## HealthKart Food Label Cataloging Application
### Overview
This application is designed to process images of food labels, extract nutritional information, and determine whether the food is healthy or unhealthy. It leverages Google Cloud Vision for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and a generative AI model to analyze the text. The processed data is then stored in a MongoDB database.
